# bamazon

Completed all 3 challenges.

- Used Cli-table npm module
- Created package for easy download and use
- Used a separate 'keys' module for privacy, to be sent directly to recipient before use
- except for bamazoncustomer, introduced the query selections and their arguments separately
  	for ease of maintenance and future development
- Grouped tasks in reusable functions

- Video demo at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwBG5vUa4W0&feature=youtu.be



FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:

- It should be possible to further consolidate the code 
- Parts common to all modules can be taken out and put into their own module 
  	to avoid repetition
- A main module can be developed to group all 3 modules into one easy to use program
	 by using inquirer to select one of 3 users at the beginning
